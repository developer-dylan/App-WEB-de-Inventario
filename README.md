# Inventory Management Web App

This is a simple inventory system made with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
It allows users to manage products with basic actions.

## Features

## Purpose

This project is part of the Module 3 - Week 2 training.  
It helps practice:

- Objects and arrays in JavaScript
- Functions and form events
- DOM manipulation
- Show and hide forms

## How to Use

1. Open the file `index.html` in a web browser.
2. Click the buttons to show a form (add, delete, update, or list).
3. Fill the form and submit.
4. Products are saved in memory (data resets when the page reloads).
